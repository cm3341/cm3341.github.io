### Carolina Montes Garcia

Welcome to my personal space. My journey has been rooted in community-centered research and public health, particularly within underserved populations. I currently work as a Project Manager at Columbia University's Center for Environmental Health and Justice in Northern Manhattan, where I bring together communities, researchers, and public health initiatives. My experiences span from managing large-scale clinical research projects to developing outreach programs for minority mental health and advancing environmental justice in urban settings.

Currently, my interests focus on the intersections of climate and health, with a keen interest in understanding the migration patterns of individuals displaced by climate events and the health impacts of displacement. Additionally, I am an artist who finds expression through oil, watercolor, and mixed media collage, exploring themes of the self and internal states, cultural identity, and nature.
