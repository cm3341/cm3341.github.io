Welcome to my professional page. My journey has been rooted in community-centered research and public health, particularly within underserved populations. I currently work as a project manager at Columbia University's NIEHS P30 Center for Environmental Health and Justice in Northern Manhattan, where I help foster collaborations between community partners and researchers. My experiences span from managing large-scale clinical research projects to developing outreach programs for minority mental health and advancing environmental justice in urban settings.

Currently, my interests lie at the intersections of climate and health, with aninterest in understanding the migration patterns of individuals displaced by climate events and the health impacts of displacement. 
In my spare time, I am an artist who finds expression through oil, watercolor, and mixed media collage, exploring themes of the self, internal states, cultural identity, and nature.
