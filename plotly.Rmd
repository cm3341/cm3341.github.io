### HEre are some plots

today' we're making interacive plots in plotly. we'll make examples using the NYC airbnb dataset.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(plotly)
```

Do some initial data cleaning/subsetting.
```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb =
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(rating = review_scores_location/2) %>% 
  select(rating, neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood,
         room_type, lat, long, price) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  filter(
    neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price%in% 100:500
  )
```

use plotly to make some quick plots

```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Price: $", price, "\nNeighborhood: ", neighbourhood)) %>% #the \n prefix makes it so I can add another text label in a new line
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, color = ~price, text = ~text_label, # notice the different format for aesthetic mapping in plot_tly, just a bit different from ggplot.
  type = "scatter", mode = "markers", alpha = 0.5
  )
```


```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, price)) %>% #this is how to reorder the order of this factor by price instead of alphabetical order
  plot_ly(
    x = ~neighbourhood, y = ~price, color = ~neighbourhood,
    type = "box", colors = "viridis"
  )
```


```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  count(neighbourhood) %>% #need to add this count variable for bar charts
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, n)) %>% #we reordered by count so the chart goes from smallest count to the largest count
  plot_ly( x = ~neighbourhood, y = ~n, 
           type = "bar")
```

some additional charts were shown
